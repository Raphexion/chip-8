A range of ROMS are already included - all of which are in public domain.

Credit to Thomas P. Greene. for providing proper documentation of
the [Chip-8 specification](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM).

This project is somewhat inspired by Alexander
Dickson's [Chip-8 emulator](https://github.com/alexanderdickson/Chip-8-Emulator)
written in JavaScript.

You can try a running version of the emulator [here](http://dragonwasrobot.github.io/chip-8/).
